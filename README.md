# IoT-Maker-Den-Mono-.NET-on-Raspberry-Pi2
IoT Maker Den migrated and implemented on Mono .NET on Raspberry Pi 2

Documentation in progress

Please refer to the [IoT Maker Den on .NET Micro Framework on Netduino documentaion](https://github.com/MakerDen/IoT-Maker-Den-NETMF/blob/master/README.md)

#Setting up Mono on Raspberry Pi

More to come, but for now refer to this excellent article of setting up Mono on your Raspberry Pi.[Getting started with the Raspberry Pi 2, for .NET developers](http://j.tlns.be/2015/02/getting-started-with-the-raspberry-pi-2-for-net-developers/)


# What is the Internet of Things Solution Accelerator?

The Internet of Things Solution Accelerator for the .NET Micro Framework provides a pluggable foundation to support sensors, actuators, data serialisation, communications, and command and control.

## Extensible/pluggable framework supporting

1. Sensors
 * Physical: Light, Sound, Temperature, CPU Temperature
 * Virtual: Memory Usage, Diagnostics
 * Sensor data serialised to a JSON schema

2. Actuators
 * LED, 
 * Adafruit Mini 0.8" 8x8 LED Matrix
     - Low and high level pixel frame transformation primitives 
     - alphanumeric character and symbol drawing and scrolling capability 
3. Command and Control
 * Control relays, send messages to a Adafruit Mini 8x8 Matrix etc via the communications layer

4. Communications
 * Pluggable â€“ currently implemented on MQTT ([Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org) MQTT Server running on Azure)

5. Supported and Tested
 * Raspberry Pi 2 and B+
 * [Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition, Express Desktop, Std, Pro and above](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx)
 * [Targets .NET 4.5 on Mono .NET on Raspberry Pi](http://www.mono-project.com/)


## IoT Dashboard
The IoT Dashboard allows you to visualise the data streamed to Azure. 

![IoT Dashboard](https://github.com/MakerDen/IoT-Maker-Den-Mono-.NET-on-Raspberry-Pi-2/blob/master/MakerDenMono/Lab%20Code/IoTDashboard.JPG)

You can install the IoT Dashboard from [here](http://iotmakerdendashboard.azurewebsites.net/install/publish.htm).  Note, you will need to allow to run from unknown publisher.
